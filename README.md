  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run ```run.bat``` - Wait and enjoy!

## Optional

Open ```run.bat``` and edit following variables suitable to your needs

```-th``` (int) number of threads you want to be used by the program

```-pool``` (bool) either true or false if you want to use this tool accross multiple instances on a network, requires you to set variables ```pool_addr``` & ```pool_port``` within ```ProfInc.py``` to be able to use this option.

## FAQ

#### Can I run it without being connected to the internet?

Sure! Note, that ```-pool``` requires an active internet connection.

I dont know, maybe hit up the OG @NonameHunt as the original owner of this repo and ask him/her.
